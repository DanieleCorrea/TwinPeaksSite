        <h2>Laura Palmer 1971-1989</h2>
        <p>
            Laura Palmer was the daughter and only child of Leland and Sarah Palmer of Twin Peaks, Washington. Laura was
            found murdered, at the age of seventeen, on the morning of February 24, 1989, an event that shook the small
            town to its core and prompted an investigation by FBI agent Dale Cooper.


            Delivered by Doctor Will Hayward, Laura was born on July 22, 1971, in the town of Twin Peaks, Washington,
            the only child of Leland and Sarah Palmer.
            Laura was baptized by Clarence Brocklehurst, who also instructed her in Sunday school. Laura would comment
            that Brocklehurst talked too much.
