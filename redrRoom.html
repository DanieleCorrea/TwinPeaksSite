                <h2 class="redtext">THE RED ROOM</h2>

                The red room, also known as "the waiting room," was an anomalous extradimensional space connected to
                Glastonbury Grove in Twin Peaks' Ghostwood National Forest. First discovered as early as the 1800s,
                the red room was believed by many to be the Black Lodge of local Native American legend. Many
                spirits appeared to "live" in the red room, most notably one calling itself "the arm."

                <h2 class="redtext">Properties</h2>
                The red room was more accurately a set of seemingly infinite rooms and hallways, the only walls
                being the thick red velvet curtains that marked the division between different sections. The
                curtains' height and anchor was unclear. In one instance, the curtains lifted to reveal an endless
                black expanse beyond, the patterned floor stretching out into nothingness. <br>
                <br> The floor was covered in a distinctive, alternating off-white and dark-brown chevron pattern. It
                was
                composed of a hard material, although in one of Dale Cooper's dreams it was instead a patterned
                carpet. On one occasion, the arm's doppelganger somehow caused the floor to shake and break apart,
                revealing a body of water underneath. <br>
                <br> Generally speaking, earthly laws of physics did not necessarily apply within the red room, as its
                arrangement could change from moment to moment, making navigation or escape extremely difficult. The
                passage of time was equally nebulous; Cooper and Annie Blackburn appeared to be present in the room
                in a dream of Laura Palmer, over a month before they actually entered it. <br>
                <br> One disturbing phenomenon encountered in the room was the doppelganger, a malevolent duplicate of a
                person or spirit distinguished by its fogged white eyes. <br>
