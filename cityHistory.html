        <h2>Twin Peaks, Washington</h2>
        <p>
            Twin Peaks was a small logging town in northeastern Washington State, five miles south of the Canadian
            border
            and twelve miles west of the state line with Idaho. Its population was stated to be 51,201 on
            the
            welcome sign, before the 1990 census established that the real population was 5,120.1.Twin Peaks drew its
            name from the two mountains between which it lay, White Tail and Blue Pine Mountain.

        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>
            Sometime around August 1803, Dominick Renault arrived on the shore of Black Lake and opened a trading post a
            half mile above White Tail Falls.
            It has been alleged that Lewis and Clark took a route that passed what would eventually become the town of
            Twin Peaks. The source of this claim is a June 1805 journal entry by Meriwether Lewis, who described "two
            mountains of a singular appearance and more like ramparts of high fortification than works of nature."
            Between 1875 and 1880, Owl Cave was discovered by men named Denver Bob Hobbes and Wayne Chance. This was
            just east of what later became Twin Peaks, within the present-day location of Ghostwood National Forest.
            By 1888, the town of Twin Peaks existed along the shores of Black Lake and was settled by refugees,
            trappers, and thieves. The chief exports were dealt through Wakahannawawak Trading Post (eventually renamed
            Thor's Trading Post) and consisted of furs and potables. It is also rumored that opium was traded at the
            post.
            Lumber would become the town's chief export with the opening of the Martell Mill, which would eventually be
            overtaken by the Packard Sawmill, which opened three years later and would continue to have the highest
            employment in Twin Peaks until 1989.
            A blizzard hit the town on December 19, 1889, and claimed the lives of over 43 citizens in the blizzard's
            first ten minutes alone.
            The town's first mayor was John Hanford, who had been elected by July 4, 1891, when he created a cocktail
            called the "Little Scottie."
            On the night of February 24, 1902, a logjam on the river caught fire and spread onto the land of the town,
            claiming the lives of eight citizens. This event would later be referred to as "The Night of the Burning
            River."
            In 1905, Orville Horne arrived in Twin Peaks and opened Horne's General Store, which flourished after Thor's
            Trading Post suspiciously burned down. It would eventually evolve into Horne's Department Store by the
            1920s.
            Orville Horne's son J.J. eventually opened the Great Northern Hotel, which went on to be operated (along
            with Horne's Department Store) by J.J.'s son, Benjamin.
            A local screening of the film 49th Parallel inspired a surge in local enlistment and necessitated the
            formation of the volunteer group Citizens Brigade. The group was led by Sheriff Frederick Truman and
            recruited men with the purpose of defending the town. This group would later go on to be known as the
            Bookhouse Boys.
            Dwayne Milford was elected mayor of Twin Peaks in 1962, and served fourteen consecutive two-year terms.
            The town held its first-annual Miss Twin Peaks Contest in 1969, crowning Norma Jennings as its winner. The
            1973 winner died of an electric shock during the ceremony, and a moment of silence is held for her at the
            town's annual Candlelighting and Christmas Tree Ceremony.
            On February 24, 1989, the town was shaken by the murder of its homecoming queen, Laura Palmer. Due to her
            murder being similar to the previous murder of Teresa Banks in Deer Meadow, Washington, the Federal Bureau
            of Investigation took helm of the case with Special Agent Dale Cooper.
